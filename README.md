## 📖 About The Project

**QryptGen** is a quantum GAN-based framework designed to generate high-entropy image encryption keys using chaotic data distributions.

Unlike traditional GANs that focus on generating distinct visual patterns (e.g., MNIST, faces), QryptGen demonstrates that **Quantum Machine Learning (QGAN)** can effectively learn from **non-descript, chaotic data distributions**—specifically Lorenz, Henon, and Logistic map systems. This project aims to produce 28x28 grayscale encryption keys that offer robust security comparable to classical deep learning methods, making it suitable for high-security domains such as military communication and medical image privacy (X-ray, CT, MRI).

### Key Features
* **Quantum GAN Architecture:** Leverages quantum circuits to capture complex data distributions.
* **Chaotic Data Utilization:** Trains on high-entropy data from chaotic systems to ensure unpredictability.
* **Secure Key Generation:** Generates 28x28 grayscale images serving as robust encryption keys.
* **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Bridges the gap between Quantum Computing, Chaos Theory, and Cryptography.
